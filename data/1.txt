Keyword Extraction is an important task in several text analysis endeavours. In this paper, we present a critical discussion of the issues and challenges in
graph-based keyword extraction methods, along with comprehensive empirical
analysis. We propose a parameterless method for constructing graph of text that
captures the contextual relation between words. A novel word scoring method is
also proposed based on the connection between concepts. We demonstrate that
both proposals are individually superior to those followed by the state-of-the-
art graph-based keyword extraction algorithms. Combination of the proposed
graph construction and scoring methods leads to a novel, parameterless keyword
extraction method (sCAKE) based on semantic connectivity of words in the document.
